# Features

## Mnemonic Sensors

![mnemonic_sensors](imgs/mnemonic_sensors.gif)

Marks known sensor signatures with a circle, making it easier to identify that a sensor blip is just 
a cargo pod full of metal that you left behind rather than some shiny loot or hostile fleet.

## Gate Markers

![gate_markers](imgs/gate_markers.png)

Indicate systems that have a gate with a marker on the star map (when not in Starscape view) to make route-planning easier. 

## Trash Disposal

![trash_disposal](imgs/trash_disposal.png)

Removes low-value commodities, such as ore, from the loot screen when your cargo bays are close to full. 
Fully customizable via LunaSettings.

## Grid-less system maps

![grid_less](imgs/gridless_system_map.png)

Remove the grid from system maps, making it easier to spot things. Feature was pitched and implemented by Genir, 
many thanks to Genir for contributing it to this mod!
