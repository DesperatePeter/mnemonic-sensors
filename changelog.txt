=== For Starsector 0.97a ===

- 0.1.1: initial release, containing four features. All features can be disabled via LunaSettings

Mnemonic Sensors: Mark known sensor readings to prevent you from chasing your own cargo pods
Gate Markers: Mark systems with gates on the Star Map once you have unlocked gate travel
Trash Disposal: Automatically remove low-value items from loot screen (if your cargo is almost full). Cf. LunaSettings for details
Grid-less System Maps: Remove the grid from system maps for a more beautiful exploration experience. Code and idea contributed by Genir, many thanks and all credits to him!


Note:

This mod was previously called MnemonicSensors. However, since that mod was abandoned and the mnemonic sensor functionality
is only one part of this mod, I have decided to repurpose this repository for the MnemonicUtils mod.
